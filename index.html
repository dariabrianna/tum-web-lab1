        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am a third-year student at TUM University pursuing a degree in software engineering. 
          I used to play professional tennis and have completed internships as both a project manager 
          and a front-end developer over the past two years. I also spent time studying International 
          Business and Administration in Vienna. I aspire to become a specialized front-end programmer 
          and I enjoy drawing in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the technical realm, I spent time studying International Business 
            and Administration in Vienna, which deepened my global perspective and 
            honed my communication skills. Whether I'm optimizing a user interface 
            or organizing team sprints, I approach every challenge with focus and 
            creativity.
