### üåü Technical Requirements

- Use semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Include proper meta tags and page title
- Use the provided HTML template as starting point
- Ensure valid HTML structure
- Make content accessible and well-structured

### üìù HTML Template

Start with this basic template:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Your Name - CV/Resume</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your resume content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## üîÑ Git Workflow Requirements

### Pull Request Strategy

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Each section must be added in a separate Pull Request (PR)

#### Required Pull Requests:

1. **PR #1**: `Add basic index.html` - Initial HTML structure with template
2. **PR #2**: `Add basic information section` - Name, contact details
3. **PR #3**: `Add personal description section` - Professional summary
4. **PR #4**: `Add education section` - Schools, courses, memories
5. **PR #5**: `Add projects section` - Project showcase
6. **PR #6**: `Add [additional section name]` - Your chosen extra section

### Git Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ DO:
- Create feature branches for each section
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Rebase or squash commits when merging PRs
- Review your own PRs before merging

#### ‚ùå DON'T:
- **NEVER** create PRs to the original course repository (üìâ -1 point penalty)
- Don't use merge commits
- Don't work directly on the main branch
- Don't create oversized commits

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/basic-info
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add basic information section with contact details"
   ```

3. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/basic-info
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Go to your forked repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your feature branch
   - Add descriptive title and description

5. **Review and merge**:
   - Review your own PR
   - Use "Squash and merge" or "Rebase and merge"
   - Delete the feature branch after merging

6. **Repeat for each section**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Complete this lab during class time**
- **Do not create PRs to the original course repository** (penalty: -1 point)
- **Each student works on their own fork**
- **Ask questions if Git workflow is unclear**
- **Focus on learning the process, not just completing the task**

## üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Can't create PR
**Solution**: Make sure you're creating PR in your own fork, not the original repository

### Issue: Merge conflicts
**Solution**: Keep your main branch updated with upstream changes

### Issue: Wrong commit in PR
**Solution**: Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history

### Issue: Forgot to create branch
**Solution**: Create branch from current state, then reset main branch

## üìû Getting Help

1. **Check the documentation** first
2. **Ask classmates** for Git workflow help
3. **Raise hand during class** for immediate assistance
4. **Create GitHub issue** in your repo describing the problem

**Good luck with your first web development lab!** üöÄ

*Remember: This is about learning the process as much as creating the final product.*
